# Meeting Agenda & Pre-Read Generator

**Required inputs:** meeting_type, attendees, duration, key_decision_or_topic

## Purpose
Create a structured meeting agenda with pre-read materials that ensures meetings are productive, time-bounded, and outcome-focused. Designed to eliminate rambling meetings and ensure participants come prepared.

## Core Philosophy
**Every meeting should answer:** Why are we meeting? What decision needs to be made? What should attendees do before, during, and after?

## Document Sections

### 1. Meeting Header (Top of Document)
```
Meeting: [Descriptive Title]
Date & Time: [Date, Time, Duration]
Attendees: [Names and roles]
Meeting Owner: [Person responsible]
Location/Link: [Physical location or video link]
```

### 2. Meeting Objective (1-2 sentences)
State the single primary goal. Examples:
- "Decide whether to proceed with vendor A or B for CRM migration"
- "Align on Q1 2026 marketing campaign themes and budget allocation"
- "Review customer feedback and prioritize product roadmap items"

### 3. Pre-Read Materials (What to review BEFORE the meeting)
List any documents, data, or context attendees must review:
- Link to relevant documents
- Estimated reading time
- Key questions to consider while reviewing

### 4. Agenda (Time-boxed)
Break the meeting into segments with strict time limits:

```
[0:00-0:10] Context setting & objectives
[0:10-0:30] Discussion: [specific topic]
[0:30-0:45] Decision making: [specific decision]
[0:45-0:60] Action items & next steps
```

**Rules:**
- No agenda item longer than 20 minutes without a break point
- Always include 5-10 minutes for action items at the end
- Build in buffer time for complex topics

### 5. Expected Outcomes
Be explicit about what should be achieved:
- Decisions made: [list specific decisions]
- Action items assigned: [yes/no - will be documented]
- Follow-up meeting needed: [yes/no]

### 6. Parking Lot Topics (Optional but recommended)
Pre-identify topics that are important but out of scope for this meeting. Prevents derailing.

## Tone & Language
- **Directive:** Use action verbs (decide, review, align, prioritize)
- **Specific:** Avoid vague phrases like "discuss strategy" (discuss WHAT about strategy?)
- **Respectful of time:** Acknowledge that attendees are busy

## Output Format
Produce a clean, scannable document that can be:
- Sent in a calendar invite
- Pasted into Confluence/Notion
- Printed as a one-pager

**Length:** 300-500 words maximum (people won't read more)

## Quality Standards

**Required elements:**
- Clear objective that can be achieved in the time allocated
- Time stamps for each agenda item
- Pre-read materials clearly marked
- Named meeting owner/decision maker

**Avoid:**
- Meetings without decisions or clear outcomes
- Agendas that try to cover too many topics
- Missing time allocations
- Vague action items like "follow up on X"

## Example Output

```
Meeting: Q4 Budget Allocation - Marketing vs Product
Date & Time: November 5, 2025, 2:00-3:00pm GMT
Attendees: CMO (Sarah), CPO (James), CFO (Michael), CEO (Lisa - decision maker)
Location: Board Room / Zoom link

Objective: Decide final budget split between Marketing (40/60/20 proposal) and Product (30/50/20 proposal) for Q4, and identify one initiative to defer to 2026.

Pre-Read (15 min):
- Q3 spending analysis (linked)
- Marketing's 40/60/20 proposal deck (linked)
- Product's 30/50/20 counter-proposal (linked)

Agenda:
[0:00-0:10] Frame the decision: constraints, trade-offs, and criteria
[0:10-0:25] Marketing presents rationale (10 min + 5 min Q&A)
[0:25-0:40] Product presents rationale (10 min + 5 min Q&A)
[0:40-0:50] Open discussion: implications of each scenario
[0:50-0:58] CEO decision + rationale
[0:58-1:00] Confirm action items and communication plan

Expected Outcomes:
- Final Q4 budget allocation decided
- One initiative deferred to 2026 (named)
- Communication plan for affected teams

Parking Lot:
- Hiring plan adjustments (to be addressed in separate meeting)
- 2026 annual planning process
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
❌ "Discussion about Q4 strategy" (too vague)
❌ 60-minute meeting with 8 agenda items (impossible)
❌ No pre-read materials for a complex decision
❌ No named decision-maker
❌ "Review progress" without defining what decision this informs
