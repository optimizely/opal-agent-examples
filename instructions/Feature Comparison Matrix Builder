# Feature Comparison Matrix Builder

**Required inputs:** product_name, competitors (list), feature_categories

## Purpose
Generate an objective, data-driven comparison matrix that positions {{product_name}} against {{competitors}} across {{feature_categories}}. This is designed for internal sales enablement and public-facing competitive analysis.

## Audience & Tone
- **Primary audience:** Sales teams, product marketing, potential customers
- **Tone:** Neutral and factual (avoid obvious bias), professional, data-focused
- **Approach:** Let the data speak; don't use subjective language like "best" or "superior"

## Structure & Format

### Matrix Layout:
1. **Header row:** Feature categories
2. **First column:** Competitor names (alphabetical, with your product highlighted)
3. **Cells:** Use ✓ (full support), ◐ (partial support), ✗ (not available), or specific values

### Supporting Sections:
- **Methodology note:** Brief explanation of how data was gathered (e.g., "Based on public documentation as of [date]")
- **Legend:** Clear definition of symbols or scoring
- **Last updated:** Date stamp for credibility

## Requirements

**Data accuracy:**
- Only include verifiable information
- Cite sources where possible (documentation, pricing pages, verified reviews)
- Mark any uncertain data with asterisk and footnote

**Visual hierarchy:**
- Use color coding sparingly (green for your product's row, neutral for others)
- Bold your product name
- Keep columns aligned and scannable

**Fairness:**
- Don't misrepresent competitor features
- Include features where competitors excel
- Avoid cherry-picking only favorable comparisons

## Output Specifications
- **Format:** Markdown table with 4-8 competitors maximum
- **Length:** 10-15 feature rows (more becomes unreadable)
- **Additional content:** 2-3 sentence summary highlighting key differentiators
