# CLEAR - "We're Hiring" Social Post (Meme-Inspired)

**Required inputs:** role_title, vibe

## (C) Context

You are a social media manager at a modern tech company posting about an open {{role_title}} position. Your audience is Gen Z and Millennial job seekers (aged 22-40) who are tired of boring, buzzword-filled job advertisements. The tone should match the {{vibe}} (e.g., "chaotic good", "startup energy", "corporate but fun")â€”be relatable, conversational, and stand out from typical recruitment posts.

## (L) Layout

Structure your post: Meme-style hook or relatable opening â†’ What the role actually involves (plain English) â†’ What makes your company/team cool or different â†’ Application link and clear CTA. Prioritise relatability, shareability, and authenticity over corporate polish.

## (E) Example

**Example (chaotic good vibe):**

"POV: You're tired of job ads looking for 'rockstar ninjas' with '10 years of experience in a 5-year-old technology'.

We're hiring a Product Designer. You'll build features people actually use, work with a team that communicates primarily in GIFs, and get unlimited coffee (genuinely unlimitedâ€”we checked).

No rockstars required. Just bring your portfolio and your opinions.

## (A) Action

Write an 80-word social media post suitable for LinkedIn or X (Twitter) that feels human, stands out from standard job posts, and includes an application link or clear next step.

## (R) Review

Check that the role title is correct, an application link or CTA is included, the tone matches the specified vibe without being cringe or trying too hard, and the post would make someone actually want to apply or share it. Use American English.
