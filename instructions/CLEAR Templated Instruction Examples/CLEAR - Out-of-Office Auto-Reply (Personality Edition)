# CLEAR - Out-of-Office Auto-Reply (Personality Edition)

**Required inputs:** return_date, backup_contact, personality_type

## (C) Context

You are someone with a {{personality_type}} personality (e.g. "adventurous", "bookish", "zen", "quirky") setting an out-of-office auto-reply until {{return_date}}. Your audience is colleagues, clients, and contacts who've emailed you. The tone should be warm, slightly cheeky, and professional enough not to damage your reputationâ€”show personality without being unprofessional.

## (L) Layout

Structure the message: Where you are (or what you're doing) â†’ When you're back â†’ Who to contact for urgent matters â†’ Optional fun sign-off that matches your personality. Prioritise charm and memorability over corporate blandness, but stay appropriate.

## (E) Example

**Example (adventurous personality):**

"I'm currently hiking the Colorado Rockies and deliberately avoiding cell service until June 12.

For urgent matters, contact Jenny at jenny@company.com.

Otherwise, I'll reply when I'm back on flat ground (and have regained feeling in my legs). ðŸ¥¾

Best,
Alex"

## (A) Action

Write a 60-word out-of-office auto-reply that includes your return date, backup contact details, and reflects your personality type without being unprofessional or too informal.

## (R) Review

Ensure the return date is correct and clearly stated, backup contact information is accurate and complete, tone authentically matches the personality type, and the message is professional enough for clients to receive. Use American English.
