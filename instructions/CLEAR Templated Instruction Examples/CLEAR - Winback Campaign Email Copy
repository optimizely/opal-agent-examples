"Hi Sarah,

We've noticed you haven't logged into WorkSync lately, and we wanted to check in. Since you last used the platform, we've launched real-time collaboration tools and enhanced our mobile experience—features our active teams say have transformed their workflows.

We understand priorities shift. If there was something that didn't work for you, we'd genuinely value your feedback.

To make it easy to explore what's new, we're offering {{incentive}} if you'd like to give us another try.
