# OKR (Objectives & Key Results) Writer

**Required inputs:** team_or_department, time_period, strategic_priority

## Purpose
Write clear, measurable, and ambitious OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) that align {{team_or_department}} with company strategy during {{time_period}} while focusing on {{strategic_priority}}. This framework helps teams set goals that are inspirational yet trackable.

## OKR Framework Overview

**Objective:** The inspirational, qualitative goal (the "what" and "why")
**Key Results:** 3-5 measurable outcomes that prove you achieved the objective (the "how we'll know")

## Writing Effective Objectives

### Characteristics of Strong Objectives:
- **Inspirational:** Makes the team excited about achieving it
- **Qualitative:** Describes an aspirational state, not a metric
- **Time-bound:** Achievable within the time period (usually quarterly)
- **Aligned:** Connects to company strategy
- **Action-oriented:** Uses active verbs

### Formula:
**[Action Verb] + [What] + [Why/Impact]**

**Strong Examples:**
- "Become the most trusted security solution for mid-market healthcare companies"
- "Transform our onboarding experience to drive customer success"
- "Establish our brand as a thought leader in sustainable logistics"

**Weak Examples:**
- ❌ "Increase revenue" (not inspirational, just a metric)
- ❌ "Improve the product" (too vague, no clear direction)
- ❌ "Support the sales team" (not outcome-focused)

## Writing Effective Key Results

### Characteristics of Strong Key Results:
- **Measurable:** Has a specific number or outcome
- **Achievable but ambitious:** Should aim for 70% confidence (not 100%)
- **Outcome-based:** Measures results, not activities
- **Specific:** No ambiguity about what "done" means
- **Limited in number:** 3-5 per objective (not 10)

### Formula:
**[Metric] from [Starting Point] to [Target] by [Date]**

Or: **Achieve [Specific Outcome] measured by [Metric]**

**Strong Examples:**
- "Increase NPS from 32 to 50"
- "Launch in 3 new markets with at least 10 customers each"
- "Reduce average support ticket resolution time from 24hrs to 4hrs"
- "Achieve 95% uptime (measured monthly)"

**Weak Examples:**
- ❌ "Launch new features" (output, not outcome)
- ❌ "Have more customer conversations" (activity, not result)
- ❌ "Improve performance" (not measurable)
- ❌ "Increase engagement" (which engagement? by how much?)

## Quality Checklist

**For Objectives:**
- [ ] Inspires the team (not just management)
- [ ] Clear even to someone outside the team
- [ ] Achievable in the time period with focus
- [ ] Aligned with broader company goals
- [ ] Doesn't include metrics or numbers

**For Key Results:**
- [ ] Has a specific, measurable target
- [ ] Measuring outcome, not output or activity
- [ ] Ambitious (70% confidence, not 95%)
- [ ] Baseline/starting point is clear
- [ ] Can be tracked regularly (weekly/monthly)
- [ ] 3-5 per objective (not more)

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Pitfall 1: Confusing outputs with outcomes**
- ❌ "Ship 5 new features" → ✅ "Increase feature adoption by 40%"

**Pitfall 2: Too many Key Results**
- Having 8 KRs per objective means nothing is truly a priority

**Pitfall 3: Sandbagging (100% achievable goals)**
- OKRs should be ambitious; hitting 70-80% is success

**Pitfall 4: Making Objectives too metric-focused**
- ❌ "Increase ARR by 50%" → ✅ "Become the market leader in our segment"

**Pitfall 5: Activity-based Key Results**
- ❌ "Have 50 sales calls" → ✅ "Generate $1M in pipeline from outbound"

## Output Format

**Provide:**
1. 2-3 Objectives (maximum) for the team/period
2. 3-5 Key Results per Objective
3. Brief context note explaining strategic alignment (2-3 sentences)

**Length:** Each Objective should be 8-15 words; each Key Result should be 8-20 words

**Tone:** Objectives are inspirational; Key Results are clinical and precise

## Context Note Template

"These OKRs support [company strategy/priority] by focusing on [key theme]. Success would mean [impact on business/customers]. We've prioritized [what we're saying no to] in order to achieve these goals."

**Remember:** OKRs are not a task list. They're a tool for alignment, focus, and measuring ambitious outcomes. When in doubt, ask: "If we achieved this, would it fundamentally move the business forward?"
